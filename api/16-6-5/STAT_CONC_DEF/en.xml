	<data>The Ibrahim Index of Governance in Africa (IIAG) is a tool for measuring and monitoring governance performance in African countries. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation defines governance as access to goods and public services, in the political, social and economic fields to which each citizen can legitimately claim from his state and which every state is required to offer to its fellow citizens. Within the framework of the IIAG, a country&apos;s governance performance is measured using four components: Security and Rule of Law, Participation and Human Rights,
Sustainable economic development and human development.</data>
